The tidy data set contains a table of 180 observations across 81 variables. The transformation from the original data set to the tidy data set is clearly explained in README.md

subject
 Numeric value between 1 and 30 (both included). Indicates the id of the subject

activity
 One of the following:
  WALKING
  WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  SITTING
  STANDING
  LAYING
 This indicates what the corresponding subject was doing while the measurement was taken. The labels are taken from activity_labels.txt from the source data.

columns 3 to 81 are the column means of the 'mean' and 'std' measurements grouped per subject-activity pair.
The column names for 3 to 81 are:
